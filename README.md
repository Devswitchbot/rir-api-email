Rossum's Invoice Robot - email API gateway
==========================================

This is a sample (Python) implementation of email gateway for
Rossum's Invoice Robot API.

Attachments in email delivered to the `apiforward.py` script are
submitted to the RIR API, captured data from the attachments is
then composed in a CSV table and returned back to the sender.
See the top of the script for usage details.
